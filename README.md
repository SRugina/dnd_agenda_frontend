# dnd_agenda_frontend

This frontend for a hobby mini-project of a DnD-flavoured event planning web app was a first attempt at using Vue.js as part of a web app. In conjunction with the [backend](), it implemented JWT Tokens for login, as well as being a first attempt at using service workers to enable offline functionality. Using realworld.io as an initial guide, the codebase demonstrates a understanding of key aspects for frontend projects such as state management, though it lacked proper commenting & documentation of code, as well as a lack of tests due to its hobbyist/first-attempt nature that was more focused on learning the core ideas involved with implementing a frontend on a knowledge-level than creating a concrete open-source codebase with strong style and best practices etc.
